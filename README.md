# Journal - Travel blog concept

Journal is a super simple travel blog concept showcasing some fancy animations created using Framer Motion.

The main feature is route transitions with shared components (images in this case).

## Main Technologies used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

## Setup

To run this project, clone it and install it locally using npm:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:hugotiger/journal.git
$ cd journal
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Possible improvements

- Make the transition hook more generic
- Match css style properties between shared element (e.g. transform properties)
- Better support for browser navigation
  - Infer which element is transitioning
- Progressive image loading
